Updates made to the source DB instance are asynchronously copied to the read replica. You can reduce the load on your source DB instance by routing read queries from your applications to the read replica.When you create a read replica, you first specify an existing DB instance as the source. Then Amazon RDS takes a snapshot of the source instance and creates a read-only instance from the snapshot. Amazon RDS then uses the asynchronous replication method for the DB engine to update the read replica whenever there is a change to the source DB instance. The read replica operates as a DB instance that allows only read-only connections. Applications connect to a read replica the same way they do to any DB instance. Amazon RDS replicates all databases in the source DB instance.Reference:https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/USER_ReadRepl.html",

We started out by launching the EBS Snapshot Copy feature late last year. This feature gave you the ability to copy a snapshot from Region to Region with just a couple of clicks. In addition, last month we made a significant reduction (26% to 83%) in the cost of transferring data between AWS Regions, making it less expensive to operate in more than one AWS region.Today we are introducing a new feature: Amazon Machine Image (AMI) Copy. AMI Copy enables you to easily copy your Amazon Machine Images between AWSRegions. AMI Copy helps enable several key scenarios including:Simple and Consistent Multi-Region Deployment \u05d2\u20ac\" You can copy an AMI from one region to another, enabling you to easily launch consistent instances based on the same AMI into different regions.Scalability \u05d2\u20ac\" You can more easily design and build world-scale applications that meet the needs of your users, regardless of their location.Performance \u05d2\u20ac\" You can increase performance by distributing your application and locating critical components of your application in closer proximity to your users.You can also take advantage of region-specific features such as instance types or other AWS services.Even Higher Availability \u05d2\u20ac\" You can design and deploy applications across AWS regions, to increase availability.Once the new AMI is in an Available state the copy is complete.Reference:https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/ec2-ami-copy-between-regions/",

When a user requests content that you're serving withCloudFront, the user is routed to the edge location that provides the lowest latency (time delay), so that content is delivered with the best possible performance.Routing traffic to an Amazon CloudFront web distribution by using your domain name.If you want to speed up delivery of your web content, you can use Amazon CloudFront, the AWS content delivery network (CDN). CloudFront can deliver your entire website \u05d2\u20ac\" including dynamic, static, streaming, and interactive content \u05d2\u20ac\" by using a global network of edge locations. Requests for your content are automatically routed to the edge location that gives your users the lowest latency.To use CloudFront to distribute your content, you create a web distribution and specify settings such as the Amazon S3 bucket or HTTP server that you wantCloudFront to get your content from, whether you want only selected users to have access to your content, and whether you want to require users to use HTTPS.When you create a web distribution, CloudFront assigns a domain name to the distribution, such asd111111abcdef8.cloudfront.net. You can use this domain name in the URLs for your content, for example:[1]Alternatively, you might prefer to use your own domain name in URLs, for example:[1]If you want to use your own domain name, use Amazon Route 53 to create an alias record that points to your CloudFront distribution. An alias record is a Route53 extension to DNS. It's similar to a CNAME record, but you can create an alias record both for the root domain, such as example.com, and for subdomains, such aswww.example.com. (You can create CNAME records only for subdomains.) When Route 53 receives a DNS query that matches the name and type of an alias record, Route 53 responds with the domain name that is associated with your distribution.Reference:https://docs.aws.amazon.com/Route53/latest/DeveloperGuide/routing-to-cloudfront-distribution.html https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudFront/latest/DeveloperGuide/Introduction.html",

You reserve the capacity in advance, so that you know it is available when you need it. You pay for the time that the instances are scheduled, even if you do not use them.Scheduled Instances are a good choice for workloads that do not run continuously, but do run on a regular schedule. For example, you can use ScheduledInstances for an application that runs during business hours or for batch processing that runs at the end of the week.If you require a capacity reservation on a continuous basis, Reserved Instances might meet your needs and decrease costs.How Scheduled Instances Work -Amazon EC2 sets aside pools of EC2 instances in each Availability Zone for use as Scheduled Instances. Each pool supports a specific combination of instance type, operating system, and network.To get started, you must search for an available schedule. You can search across multiple pools or a single pool. After you locate a suitable schedule, purchase it.You must launch your Scheduled Instances during their scheduled time periods, using a launch configuration that matches the following attributes of the schedule that you purchased: instance type, Availability Zone, network, and platform. When you do so, Amazon EC2 launches EC2 instances on your behalf, based on the specified launch specification. Amazon EC2 must ensure that the EC2 instances have terminated by the end of the current scheduled time period so that the capacity is available for any other Scheduled Instances it is reserved for. Therefore, Amazon EC2 terminates the EC2 instances three minutes before the end of the current scheduled time period.You can't stop or reboot Scheduled Instances, but you can terminate them manually as needed. If you terminate a Scheduled Instance before its current scheduled time period ends, you can launch it again after a few minutes. Otherwise, you must wait until the next scheduled time period.The following diagram illustrates the lifecycle of a Scheduled Instance.Reference:https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/ec2-scheduled-instances.html",

It can handle millions of requests per second. After the load balancer receives a connection request, it selects a target from the target group for the default rule. It attempts to open a TCP connection to the selected target on the port specified in the listener configuration.When you enable an Availability Zone for the load balancer, Elastic Load Balancing creates a load balancer node in the Availability Zone. By default, each load balancer node distributes traffic across the registered targets in its Availability Zone only. If you enable cross-zone load balancing, each load balancer node distributes traffic across the registered targets in all enabled Availability Zones. For more information, see Availability Zones.If you enable multiple Availability Zones for your load balancer and ensure that each target group has at least one target in each enabled Availability Zone, this increases the fault tolerance of your applications. For example, if one or more target groups does not have a healthy target in an Availability Zone, we remove theIP address for the corresponding subnet from DNS, but the load balancer nodes in the other Availability Zones are still available to route traffic. If a client doesn't honor the time-to-live (TTL) and sends requests to the IP address after it is removed from DNS, the requests fail.For TCP traffic, the load balancer selects a target using a flow hash algorithm based on the protocol, source IP address, source port, destination IP address, destination port, and TCP sequence number. The TCP connections from a client have different source ports and sequence numbers, and can be routed to different targets. Each individual TCP connection is routed to a single target for the life of the connection.For UDP traffic, the load balancer selects a target using a flow hash algorithm based on the protocol, source IP address, source port, destination IP address, and destination port. A UDP flow has the same source and destination, so it is consistently routed to a single target throughout its lifetime. Different UDP flows have different source IP addresses and ports, so they can be routed to different targets.An Auto Scaling group contains a collection of Amazon EC2 instances that are treated as a logical grouping for the purposes of automatic scaling and management. An Auto Scaling group also enables you to use Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling features such as health check replacements and scaling policies. Both maintaining the number of instances in an Auto Scaling group and automatic scaling are the core functionality of the Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling service.The size of an Auto Scaling group depends on the number of instances that you set as the desired capacity. You can adjust its size to meet demand, either manually or by using automatic scaling.An Auto Scaling group starts by launching enough instances to meet its desired capacity. It maintains this number of instances by performing periodic health checks on the instances in the group. The Auto Scaling group continues to maintain a fixed number of instances even if an instance becomes unhealthy. If an instance becomes unhealthy, the group terminates the unhealthy instance and launches another instance to replace it.Reference:https://docs.aws.amazon.com/elasticloadbalancing/latest/network/introduction.html https://docs.aws.amazon.com/autoscaling/ec2/userguide/AutoScalingGroup.html",
